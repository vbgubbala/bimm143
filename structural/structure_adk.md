Comparative Structure Analysis of Adenylate Kinase
================

2/18/2020

In this exercise, we run structural analyses on adenylate kinase.

``` r
#importing relevant packages

library(bio3d)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(httr)
library(msa)
```

## Retrieving ADK-like structures

First, we get the amino acid sequence of adenylate kinase, and then
perform a blast to get proteins with homologous sequences. The blast
results can be visualized in the following
    plot.

``` r
adk_seq <- get.seq("1ake_A")
```

    ## Fetching... Please wait. Done.

``` r
adk_blast <- blast.pdb(adk_seq)
```

    ##  Searching ... please wait (updates every 5 seconds) RID = 4TPM0R6K016 
    ##  ..
    ##  Reporting 99 hits

``` r
hits <- plot(adk_blast)
```

    ##   * Possible cutoff values:    197 -3 
    ##             Yielding Nhits:    16 99 
    ## 
    ##   * Chosen cutoff value of:    197 
    ##             Yielding Nhits:    16

We can visualize 1AKE with vmd,

Next, we run alignment on our blast hits and plot the results along with
a dendrogram clustering.

``` r
align_adk <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile = "msa")
```
