## In Silico drug docking to HIV-1 protease '1HSG'.

First, we download and format the 1HSG PDB structure using functions from the Bio3D package. Examining the hsg PDB variable, we see that the file contains a protein, non-protein Merck drug, and non-protein water molecules.

```{r}
hsg <- read.pdb(get.pdb('1hsg'))
protein <- trim.pdb(hsg, "protein")
ligand <- trim.pdb(hsg, "ligand")

write.pdb(protein, file = "1hsg_protein.pdb")
write.pdb(ligand, file = "1hsg_ligand.pdb")
```
Inspecting the formatted objects.
```{r}
hsg
#ligand
#protein
```

The protein and ligand files were prepared for docking using MGLTools. First, hydrogens were added to the structure, and a pdbqt file was generated to include atom charges.
